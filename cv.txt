2. Experience
Oracle PL/SQL
	20+ years in PL/SQL Development. First application was Payroll application using Oracle Forms and SQL Plus as host environments. With Oracle 7 as first version offering PL/SQL stored procedures moved development effort into that environment and started to develop enhancement to BSCS (rating and billing system for telecommunication environment). The latest PL/SQL experience coming from developing ETL parts of complex systems. 
	Oracle APEX
	5+ years in developing front end application using Oracle APEX rapid application development environment. From simple pages generated by default generator based on database table to integrating third party JavaScript libraries like knockout.js into generated pages. For example improving page functionality that supports the process of payment allocation against of invoices. Also, enhancing look and feels of the pages using custom HTML and CSS snippets.
	Oracle XMLDB
	5+ years experience in Oracle XMLDB which is part of standard Oracle installation. Registering XML schema which implies creation of underlying database tables. Generating XML documents data from database tables following predefined XML schema, using SQL/XML extension. Validating and consuming XML documents and update Oracle database.
	SQL, ETL
	5+ years in developing tools in order to load data from various external data sources and visually presenting. The code involved creation of necessary packages and views in order to load data from external files in CSV or XML format. The final step was to present data in visual format using APEX as Front End. This way millions of call data records were loaded into the system, processed and made ready for end user consumption. The development of the code required implementation of optimization techniques in order to handle big amount of data.
	Telecommunication Industry 
	10+ years in telecommunications industry. Deep knowledge of rating and billing process on retail and wholesale (Inter Operator Traffic) side. Developed supporting application for GSMA standards (EID, PNR, RTDR).

Nextgen Clearing Ltd., London City        Dec11 - Feb18
Oracle Data Warehouse, Data Mining, APEX/PLSQL Developer
The Nextgen System supports all aspects of roaming financial clearing. Invoicing, Reconciliation of incoming invoices, Settlement and Payment, Debt collection and management of revenue, fully interactive real-time reporting, Foreign Exchange Services, Inter-operator Discount Management Roaming Hubing (Open Connectivity).
Business intelligence is based on Oracle OLAP cube and Data Mining algorithms. 
* My job is to gather call data in various formats (csv and XML), load into database, create cubes (defining dimensions and measures), find and apply appropriate data mining algorithms (mainly to forecast time series)
* I have developed in house ETL system that captures external data in XML format (based on GSMA TD Standards) and stores data into database tables. 
* All screens are made using Oracle APEX. I have been using extensively all features of APEX including dynamic actions, using externally supplied plugins, developing my own plugins, HTML, JavaScript/JQuery.
* The invoices are generated during roaming connections in visited network from home subscribers. From the IT point of view the clearing process is composed of data capturing from various data sources (mainly in XML format), payable invoices reconciliation, receivable invoices generation and payment processing.
* Connecting Apache Spark to Oracle DB, fetch the data directly, and populate it in a DataFrame. After data processing updating database tables in order to expose them for APEX reports. Instead of machine learning solutions provided by Oracle, I was using tools with the capacity to solve our business quickly and efficiently. The use of Apache Spark is a common technology that can fulfill the needs. Using Oracle RDBMS instead of Hadoop environment reduces the cost involved in moving the data out of the database and then importing back.
